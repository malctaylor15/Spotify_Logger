## Spotify Logger  

Repository to save spotify listening history to database 

This will allow for future analysis of different genre's, listening trends etc 


Spotify does not allow the user to see the entire listening history at once. 
So we use spotify's API to save recently listened history to sqlite database. We can set a scheduler to check every 2 hours. 

Once the data is captured, we can do analysis later on by tracking popular artists, genre trends, and potential lyrical trends. 
This is repository simply allows for the tracking of the spotify data.
