After cloning repository, need to set up a few more things

1. Set spotify environment variables -- client id, secret key, redirect uri to data/spotify_credentials.pkl
2. Find email login parameters for the email notifications -- data/email_pw.pkl 
    -- can use config helper to set the ids and passwords 
3. Sign into spotify account to set up cache files 
    - for now, you must run the get_latest_prod notebook on the server must be run on server to go through auth workflow 
    - it will prompt you to log into your spotify account using a webpage, after logging in, you must enter that url into the notebook cell 
    - Use vnc to ssh start the jupyter notebook because it will auto open the auth workflow 
    - also a good time to change the user from "malchemist" to your spotify user name 
    - you only have to do this infrequently (until token expires) 
4. Set up cron job 
-- crontab -e 
# 10 */2 * * * bash /home/pi/Loggers/Spotify_Logger/run_notebook.sh > /tmp/spotify_logger.log 2>&1

5. Set up AWS DB backup
